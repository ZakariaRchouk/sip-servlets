SIP Servlets 
==============

To run these applications it is required that both the WebLogic Sip Serverâ„¢ and the Voxpilot VoiceXML Media Server (VMS) have already been installed and setup.
some of these application may also require Brekeke or any other Registrar for SIP register requets . Few appliation also require databse management . 

**Applications in this Git Repo include**

###Gaming Server

###IPTV
The differentiating factors of a realtime IPTV parental control application from any other parental control solution is that
it doesnt not enforce the parent  to review and restricts beforehand . Parent can review the channel / content settings at realtime ie
as and when the child requests .
Therefore it Saves the time involved in making beforehand channel settings . 

Parents can customise the solution to meet their requirnements such as realtime notification to parent can be send via
- Email ( channel link and summary ) 
- IM ( Instant message ) with reply option 
- Call and Video preview  with DTMF option

###Video Call
Simple SIP servlet application to initiate a SIP service / application. Handle the doRequest and doResponse generated after
SIPRequest and SIPResponse . Alos describes appening the call log to file for keeping trcak of calls . 

###Call Screening
Call screening service blocks a list of users from calling a subscriber, on date or/and time basis who is subscribed to this
service, and Find-Me-Follow-Me service allows a user to be reached at more that one location in round robin fashion.
Interaction logic first calls the Call Screening service to find if the caller is screened by the callee or not, and based on
the response it may forward the call to FMFM service or rejects the call attempt. The two services are independent of each 
other and could be orchestrated using the service broker to act as one single service logic.
